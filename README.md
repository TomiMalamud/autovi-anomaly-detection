# AutoVI Visual Inspection AI
This is an AI model (MobileNetV2) for detecting missing screws in tank images, based on AutoVI dataset from the Renault assembly lines.

It achieved an accuracy of 87.95%, with *very* high recall. That could indicate that the model overfits a little. There's a large room for improvement.
It has been deployed on Gradio to play with it!
